This is the official repository for _Mostly Joking_! New York City's premier comedy barbershop quartet. No one is quite sure why _Mostly Joking_ has this repository. Maybe it can become an official website one day? Who knows. The world is our clam and programming is the sad that gets stuck in our mouths that forms the pearls of our musical desires.
